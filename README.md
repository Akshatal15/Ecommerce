🛒 E-Commerce Platform Backend

Spring Boot | Java | PostgreSQL | Secure Multi-Role E-Commerce System








---

📌 1. Project Overview

This is a Spring Boot-based backend for a multi-role e-commerce platform, built on a layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
The project is designed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and covers core features like:

✅ User Management
✅ Product Catalog
✅ Order Processing
✅ Secure Payments (future)

🏗️ 4. Design & Domain Modeling

4.1 Architecture

Controller (API Layer) → REST endpoints

Service (Business Logic) → Validations, rules, transactions

Repository (Data Access) → Database operations via Spring Data JPA


4.2 Key Design Choices

🔒 Role-Based Security with Spring Security

📦 DTOs to protect entities and structure responses

🔄 @Transactional Services for data consistency

⚠️ Global Exception Handling via @RestControllerAdvice

📜 AOP Logging for method tracing & performance tracking


4.3 Core Entities

User, Role, Seller, Product, Category, Order, Payment, Review, Cart, Wishlist, Commission
